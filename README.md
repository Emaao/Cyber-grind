# Cyber-grind
My LeetCode and Cybersecurity Progress for more advanced and needed skills.

Tracking my journey through **LeetCode + Cybersecurity enhancing skills**.

## Structure
- 'leetcode/' -> coding solutions (C++/Python/Go/Bash/PowerShell).
- 'notes/' -> explanations of problems + OverTheWire/TryHackMe and other learning platforms notes.
- `scripts/' -W small automation/security tools I created during my studies.
- 'certificates/' -> Notes about the certificates I did and the ones I'm doing.

## About My Motivation

Even though I studied cybersecurity in college, I know that true growth comes from going deeper into the details, practicing constantly, and reinforcing knowledge through repetition.  
As an engineer, I believe I should not only understand the big picture but also master the small details like algorithms and systems skills. 

This repo is my way of reminding myself that learning never stops:  
- Revisit concepts I already studied.  
- Strengthen problem-solving with hands-on practice.  
- Gain new knowledge step by step.  

I see this as a continuous journey of becoming sharper, more confident, and more prepared for real-world challenges
